## The goal

The goal of the game is to accurately predict the IMDb rating of a movie, given a few of its attributes, such as, its title, poster, release year, genre, plot, director, writer, actors, runtime, etc.

## Playing the game

You can play the game [here](https://sivonpearson.github.io/movie-rating-guessing-frontend/).

Be mindful that the backend currently uses a free API key for fetching movie data from [OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/), which allows for 1,000 requests per day. This amounts to up to 500 movies per day which can be fetched.

Also, the game is still being developed, so expect errors.
